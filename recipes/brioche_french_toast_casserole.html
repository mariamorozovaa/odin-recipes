                    Use brioche to make French toast casserole for a special treat. Brioche bread is very fluffy and rich, so it
                    absorbs the milk and eggs very well but still keeps its distinct flavor. The cinnamon strusel on top falls
                    into the crevices of the bread, making every bite sweet and crunchy.

                <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more for serving</li>
                <li>1 1/2 tablespoons vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 (16-oz.) day-old brioche loaf, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>
                    Stir together brown sugar, flour, melted butter, salt, and 1/2 teaspoon of the cinnamon in a medium bowl until
                    crumbly; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly coat a 9-x 13-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Whisk together milk, heavy cream, eggs, maple
                    syrup, vanilla, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon in a large bowl until fully combined. Toss cubed
                    brioche in milk mixture until all pieces are moistened. Milk mixture will not be completely absorbed.
                </li>
                <li>Transfer mixture to prepared baking dish, and sprinkle evenly with granulated sugar.</li>
                <li>
                    Sprinkle brown sugar mixture evenly over top of bread mixture. Let casserole stand 10 minutes at room
                    temperature.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven until casserole is set and bread is golden brown and puffy, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove
                    from oven, and serve immediately with additional maple syrup.
