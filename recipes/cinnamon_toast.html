    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Picture layers of fluffy French bread coated in a decadent cinnamon-sugar blend and topped with a luscious cream
        cheese
        glaze. It’s part cinnamon roll, part French toast, and 100% delicious. Whether you make it for breakfast,
        brunch, or an
        afternoon snack, this is the easiest baked masterpiece to ever come out of your oven. <br>
        “It’s SO fun-looking,” said recipe taster Elizabeth Mervosh. “And I could honestly eat the whole thing.”

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Bread</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 (11 ounce) cans original French bread dough (such as Pillsbury)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled slightly</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Glaze</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounce cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup sifted powdered sugar</li>
        <li>3 to 4 tablespoons whole milk or half-and-half</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8.5- x 4.5-inch loaf pan
            with cooking
            spray and line with parchment paper, allowing 2 inches to hang over the long sides. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the bread: Stir together brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a small bowl until fully combined. Set
            aside. Place
            a sheet of parchment paper on a work surface. Unfurl 1 of the cans of dough and gently stretch and/or roll
            into a 10- x
            12-inch rectangle. Brush 2 tablespoons of the butter evenly over the entire dough. Sprinkle half (about
            heaping 1/3 cup)
            of the cinnamon-sugar mixture to the edges of the dough to cover completely; lightly press and smooth out to
            adhere
            (there will be some that falls off).</li>
        <li>Cut dough sheet into 12 even rectangles (about 3- x 3 1/2 inches).</li>
        <li>Stack dough rectangles on top of each other. Carefully transfer stack to prepared pan with rectangles
            standing upright
            (like dominoes). Repeat with remaining can of dough, butter, and cinnamon-sugar mixture.</li>
        <li>Transfer loaf pan to the preheated oven and bake until puffed and golden, 40 to 45 minutes, tenting with
            foil after 30
            minutes. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 5 minutes. Use parchment as handles to carefully lift
            loaf out of
            pan and onto a wire rack to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>While loaf cools, prepare the Glaze: Beat cream cheese in a medium bowl with an electric hand mixer until
            whipped. Add
            powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of the milk, vanilla, and salt; beat until smooth and creamy, adding more
            milk, 1 1/2
            teaspoons at a time, until desired consistency is reached.</li>
        <li>Drizzle desired amount of the glaze over warm or room temperature bread.</li>
        <li>Serve with remaining glaze on the side.</li>
    </ol>
